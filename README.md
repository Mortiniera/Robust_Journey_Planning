# Final project

The final notebook with CSA solution is final.ipynb and it can be runned it on the cluster.
Some helper functions helpers.py.
An other algorithm version is Cluster_idea.ipynb (not to be considered as it was too slow)

### Future improvements
1. Find categories for stop names and trip id delays in order to reduce the dimension and so the running time
2. Modify connections iterations to keep connections that we would miss but could use if the train has an usual slight delay
3. Fill missing values the departure / arrival time by performing profiling of trips / stops
